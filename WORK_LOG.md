| Aug 21 | 6-6:45 and 7-7:30pm | First we continued working on the solution with pencil and paper to try to solve it before continuing to code. Then, we started to code the for loop to create the main code break (shifting the letters by 9). Ran into some issues with running the file so I tried fixing it (it kind of worked not really). I just kept trying to troubleshoot the Junit afterwards. |

From there, I realized that the first one was easier than I thought (the poem was just weird), and started decoding the others, which was a lot quicker. I have just continued working after that and completed the first second and third ones.  |
